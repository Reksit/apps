# Flutter Mobile App Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Flutter SDK
1. Download Flutter SDK from [flutter.dev](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
2. Extract to a suitable location (e.g., `C:\flutter` on Windows)
3. Add Flutter to your PATH environment variable
4. Run `flutter doctor` to verify installation

### 2. Install Android Studio
1. Download from [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Install with default settings
3. Install Android SDK (API level 21 or higher)
4. Install Android Virtual Device (AVD) for emulator

### 3. Setup Development Environment
1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to File â†’ Settings â†’ Plugins
3. Install Flutter and Dart plugins
4. Restart Android Studio

## Project Setup

### 1. Open Project in Android Studio
1. Open Android Studio
2. Click "Open an existing project"
3. Navigate to the `flutter_app` folder
4. Click "Open"

### 2. Configure Dependencies
1. Open terminal in Android Studio
2. Run the following commands:
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter pub deps
```

### 3. Configure Backend Connection

#### For Android Emulator:
- The app is pre-configured to use `10.0.2.2:8080`
- No changes needed if backend runs on localhost:8080

#### For Physical Device:
1. Find your computer's IP address:
   - Windows: `ipconfig` in Command Prompt
   - Mac/Linux: `ifconfig` in Terminal
2. Update `lib/utils/constants.dart`:
   ```dart
   static const String baseUrl = 'http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:8080/api';
   ```
3. Ensure your device and computer are on the same network

### 4. Start Backend Server
1. Open terminal in the `alu_backend` folder
2. Run:
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
3. Verify server is running at `http://localhost:8080`

## Running the App

### 1. Using Android Emulator
1. In Android Studio, click "AVD Manager"
2. Create a new virtual device (recommended: Pixel 6 with API 33+)
3. Start the emulator
4. In terminal, run:
```bash
flutter run
```

### 2. Using Physical Device
1. Enable Developer Options on your Android device:
   - Go to Settings â†’ About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times
2. Enable USB Debugging in Developer Options
3. Connect device via USB
4. Run:
```bash
flutter run
```

### 3. Using Android Studio IDE
1. Select your target device (emulator or physical)
2. Click the "Run" button (green play icon)
3. Or press Shift+F10

## Building for Release

### 1. Build APK
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```
The APK will be generated at: `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

### 2. Build App Bundle (for Play Store)
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
```
The bundle will be generated at: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

### 3. Install APK on Device
```bash
flutter install --release
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Unable to connect to backend"
- Verify backend server is running
- Check IP address configuration
- Ensure device and computer are on same network
- Check firewall settings

#### 2. "Gradle build failed"
- Run `flutter clean`
- Run `flutter pub get`
- Restart Android Studio

#### 3. "SDK not found"
- Open Android Studio â†’ SDK Manager
- Install required SDK versions
- Update PATH environment variables

#### 4. "Device not detected"
- Enable USB Debugging on device
- Install device drivers
- Try different USB cable/port

### Performance Issues
- Use Release mode for testing: `flutter run --release`
- Clear app data if experiencing issues
- Restart emulator/device

### Network Issues
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify backend server accessibility
- Test API endpoints using Postman

## Development Tips

### 1. Hot Reload
- Press `r` in terminal for hot reload
- Press `R` for hot restart
- Use `flutter run --hot` for automatic hot reload

### 2. Debugging
- Use `print()` statements for logging
- Use Flutter Inspector in Android Studio
- Enable debug mode: `flutter run --debug`

### 3. Testing
- Run unit tests: `flutter test`
- Run integration tests: `flutter test integration_test/`
- Use Flutter Driver for UI testing

### 4. Code Quality
- Run `flutter analyze` for static analysis
- Use `flutter format .` for code formatting
- Follow Dart style guidelines

## Production Deployment

### 1. App Signing
1. Generate keystore:
```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
```

2. Create `android/key.properties`:
```properties
storePassword=<password>
keyPassword=<password>
keyAlias=upload
storeFile=<path-to-keystore>
```

3. Update `android/app/build.gradle` with signing config

### 2. Play Store Release
1. Build app bundle: `flutter build appbundle --release`
2. Upload to Google Play Console
3. Complete store listing with screenshots
4. Submit for review

### 3. Internal Distribution
- Use Firebase App Distribution
- Or distribute APK directly to testers

## Maintenance

### 1. Updates
- Regularly update Flutter SDK: `flutter upgrade`
- Update dependencies: `flutter pub upgrade`
- Monitor for security updates

### 2. Monitoring
- Implement crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics)
- Monitor app performance
- Track user analytics (privacy-compliant)

### 3. Backup
- Regular code backups
- Database backups
- Configuration backups
